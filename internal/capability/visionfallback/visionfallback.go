// Package visionfallback turns images into text for models that cannot see.
//
// It is an ingress rewriter: when a caller sends images to a model whose
// admin declared it unable to read them, the request's images are described
// through the globally configured vision model (a loopback call through this
// gateway's own API, billed to the same caller) and replaced with the
// descriptions; with no vision model configured they are replaced with
// placeholders, which keeps an upstream that would reject image parts from
// failing the whole request.
//
// It never refuses a request and never invents certainty: a model whose
// declaration is absent is left entirely alone (missing metadata must not
// degrade a vision-capable model), a body that cannot be parsed is forwarded
// as the caller sent it, and when every describe attempt fails the original
// bytes go through untouched — the upstream's own error beats silently
// dropping content.
